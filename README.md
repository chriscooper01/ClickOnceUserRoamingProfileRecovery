# ClickOnceUserRoamingProfileRecovery
Starting again as my other repos do not want to push
This is an example Application, which has been created for an application that I created to resolve the User roaming profile issue a client had.
There issue was that the Users AppData 2.0 folder was being wipped on log out or log in.
Due to this click once lost its binaries files and needed to be reinstalled.
Below is a url to my Blog entry, which talks about this solutions.
